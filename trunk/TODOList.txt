1. CodeConverter

Solution -> Project -> Item

Project:
	References;
	Folders;
	Items;
	
Item: 
	Complex Items, such as aspx, ascx, windows form, resx, xsd...
	
Add proj filter: 
	for the projects with same language to the target language, ignore them;
	for the projects with different languages, provide filter.
	
2. Simple Code Generator

This generator can be regarded as a "complex project template" or "solution template".

Sigh, the converter is very complex to implement in one or two days...

So, use the generator(NPetshop struct) as the sample program. (CommandName: NEnhancer.Connect.NPetshopSlnGenerator)

a. Create a sln, the solution name will be used to name the projects, such as SolutionName.Domain

b. Create a folder(External-bin) to store the dlls, then add a corresponding solution folder

c. Create the projects by this order: *.Domain, *.Persistence, *.Service, *.Presentation, *.Web

	for each proj in projects
		AddReferences; (dll ref & proj ref)
		AddFolders; (especially for *.Web proj, add Maps & UserControls folders)
		AddFiles; (pay special attention to web.config file, add log4net config sections)
		
d. Save solution. (Consider building the sln?)

Although it's very simple, it does show the primary manipulations on Solution/Project/Item. We can create CodeGenerator by this way.
